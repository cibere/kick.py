# kick.py

Kick.py _will_ be an async api wrapper for [kick.com](https://kick.com) once the api is public, and is documented. Though once its there, I will gladly accept help in making this :D

# TODO

- ratelimit handling (ratelimit is unknown on how it works)
- cache (idk how I will do this)
- see types folder for things that still need a payload, and perhaps a dataclass.
- asset dataclass
- Add emote support
- refactor chatroom to make more sense
- Add partials

# FAQ

> Q: Why does this package exist even though the api is not public yet?
>
> A: Because I'm too impatient, and want to start making the wrapper now
